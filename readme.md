hit crate at 10,000                                         - hitTime
crate collect time is 4,000                                 - completeTime
so completion time is 14,000
diff is completionTime - currentTime = 4,000
if moving too fast, add elapsed time to completion time
if moving too fast for 2,000
current time is 12,000
completion time is 16,000
completionTime - currentTime = 4,000

moving slow for 1,500, then move too fast again

currentTime = 13,500
completionTime = 16,000
completionTime - currentTime = 2,500
